# 🌿 Leaf-O-Clean  
### Autonomous AI-Powered Leaf Collection Robot

Leaf-O-Clean is an autonomous garden maintenance robot designed to detect, navigate toward, and collect fallen leaves from lawns and outdoor environments using Computer Vision and Robotics.

This project integrates **Machine Learning**, **Embedded Systems**, and **Autonomous Navigation Algorithms** to provide an eco-friendly alternative to traditional leaf-cleaning techniques such as manual raking or air-polluting leaf blowers.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Traditional leaf-cleaning methods are:
- Time-consuming
- Labor-intensive
- Environmentally harmful (dust & air pollution)
- Inefficient across large lawns or varied terrains  

Leaf-O-Clean addresses this by introducing a **self-navigating robotic system** capable of:
- Detecting leaves using Computer Vision
- Avoiding obstacles autonomously
- Navigating through garden environments
- Collecting leaves without human intervention  

The goal was to create a system capable of distinguishing leaves from grass with high accuracy while maintaining lawn integrity.
